  "Given Data Points: 4, 7, 10, 5, 8.",
  "Mean is equal to the sum of the data points divided by the number of data points.",
  "Adding the data points together: four plus seven plus ten plus five plus eight.",
  "This gives us a sum of thirty-four.",
  "Now, dividing the sum by the number of data points, we have: thirty-four divided by five."
